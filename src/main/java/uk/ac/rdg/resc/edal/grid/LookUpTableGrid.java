 * point are specified using two-dimensional coordinate axes, which explicitly
 * give the lat/lon of each point in the horizontal plane. In these coordinate
 * systems, finding the nearest grid point to a given lat/lon point is complex.
 * Therefore we pre-calculate a {@link LookUpTable "look-up table"} of the
 * nearest i-j indices to a set of lat-lon points. Coordinate conversions using
 * such a look-up table are not precise but may suffice for many applications.
